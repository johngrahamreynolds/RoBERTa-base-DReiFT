## ðŸ¤— Model Card

See the relevant ðŸ¤— [Model Card](https://huggingface.co/MarioBarbeque/RoBERTa-base-DReiFT) for this large multilabel text classificaiton model that I fine-tuned atop the RoBERTa-base checkpoint. This model utilizes a set of classes constructed as a work around to a current bug in the ðŸ¤— Evaluate library. The temporary code can be found in the `custom_eval_classes` folder, as well as under [ðŸ¤— Spaces](https://huggingface.co/MarioBarbeque) where it is briefly demonstrated.
